I am a network and systems engineer, and my technical skills are built around three main pillars:
– Management and deployment of network and system infrastructures
– Application development specialized in computer network systems
– Cyberattack assessment and defense

I have passionately invested myself in various projects, ranging from creative initiatives such as video game development and the implementation of autonomous intelligence to play the games I created, to more industrial and professional applications focused on optimization.

Currently, I am focusing on more structured technical projects, aiming to apply and strengthen my development skills within computer network infrastructures.
